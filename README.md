This is my final assignment for NTV second semester.

Created using v20.14.0 of node

When you run npm install you will get three errors. As I understand, this is a problem with next, not my code.

It is mostly to test if we have learned the different subjects, so not everything is as it would be for a real website.
It requires the orders-api that is included in the git repository to fully work.
I've used chatGPT scarcely, I should have marked all the places that I did.
A few times, I've hit a wall that not even chatGPT could fix, and then I realized the solution by myself, so I didn't write that I
used chatGPT there.

Install both the server and app with npm install, then run it with npm run dev

I've gotten css input from my friend who is also a web developer, but this has only been for flaws I didn't notice, and all fixes are done by me. JS code is all by me, except for the few hints I've
gotten from my teacher.
